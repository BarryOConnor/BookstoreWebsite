				<h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>We love books! Ever since opening the shop, we have strived to fulfill one single aim: to help each and every customer find their new favourite book. That's a huge claim but we feel that if the process is simple enough and you are given advice when you need it, this will help in making sure you love the books you buy.</p>
                <p>Established in 2000, we have sold millions of books, from worldwide bestsellers to local interest history books. We operate online and in your local highstreet where our friendly staff will be more than happy to have a friendly chat about what type of book you like and suggest books you may like. Every one of our staff love books as much as you do, we encourage them to read new books so that they can pass on their own personal experience directly to you.</p>
